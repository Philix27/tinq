## Introduction

Right from the early humans,women has always been a major determinet in deciding whether a baby is to be born into this world or not. She had nearly all the power in making choices regarding bearing a child, from knowing what to take to prevent this pregnancy (herbs and other traditional/ancient medicines) to having full understanding of her menstrual cycle (as seen in recent centuries), which arms her with the knowledge if knowing when she is most likely to get pregnant or not. The coming of modern medicines (e.g levonogestrel - early morning pills) which is used as a contraceptive  (at least 72 hours after sexual intercourse). All these have placed lots of power in the hands of women in decieding whether or not she is to get pregnant or not especially in our today's society where extra marital sex is being encouraged and is seen as a norm.     

## Women's perspective

Should they be scared about the coming of male contraceptives? I don't think so, because while men may have a little bit of say, they still have or has to give the final say. I agree to the fact that women still deserve the power to make the decisions regarding her body because at the end she is the one to carry the child for 9 months of extreme homonal and emotional imbalance. 


## Men's perspective

Th guys will definitely be glad about this recent development because they now have an additionallevel of protection (after condom). While some men have complained over the discomfort that comes from using condom, here comes a better alternative to stay away from unwanted pregnancy. With this additional level of safety one would expect lesser number of children being born out of wedlock or a man getting married just because he couldn't control his penis. Undoubtedly this is truly a good news for the men and an extra level of protection.
Children cannot only be had without a consensus of both parties involded.

## What to expect

1. This drug is most likely to be abused by men especially the clebrities and those who are highly insecure about their wealth properties.
2. There may be likelyhood of decline in fertility rate across the globe. 
3. The long term side effects of this drugs are yet to be discovered, we hope it doesen't make men infertile or sterile.
   
## Conclusion
1. What do you think about this drug?
2. Should this drug be regulated? If yes, by who?
